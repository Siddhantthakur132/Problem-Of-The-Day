# Daily DSA Practice Repository

Welcome to the **Daily DSA Practice** repository! 🚀 This repository is dedicated to enhancing problem-solving skills by solving at least one Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) question daily.

## Small Description
This repository serves as a personal log of daily DSA problem-solving activities, featuring problem statements, C++ solutions, and additional insights for learning and reference.

## About the Repository
This repository contains solutions to various DSA problems that I solve each day. Each solution is written in **C++** and focuses on a range of topics such as:
- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked Lists
- Stacks and Queues
- Trees and Graphs
- Recursion and Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming
- Searching and Sorting

## Structure of the Repository
The repository is organized as follows:
```
📂 Daily DSA Practice
├── 📁 Day 1
│   ├── question.md   # Problem statement
│   ├── solution.cpp  # Solution to the problem
│   └── notes.md      # Additional notes or explanations (if any)
├── 📁 Day 2
│   ├── question.md
│   ├── solution.cpp
│   └── notes.md
...
```
Each folder represents a specific day's work and includes:
1. **`question.md`**: The problem statement with the link to the platform where it was sourced (e.g., LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks).
2. **`solution.cpp`**: My solution in C++.
3. **`notes.md`** (optional): Notes or explanations related to the problem, alternative approaches, or any learning insights.

## Goals
- To consistently solve one DSA problem daily.
- To explore different types of problems and solutions.
- To improve coding efficiency and algorithmic thinking.
- To build a portfolio of solved problems for future reference.

## How to Use
Feel free to explore the repository and:
1. Review the problem statements and solutions.
2. Clone the repository and try solving the problems on your own before checking the solutions.
3. Suggest improvements or alternative solutions via **issues** or **pull requests**.

## Contributions
